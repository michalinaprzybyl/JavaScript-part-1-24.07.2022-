# JavaScript part 1 (24.07.2022)

The files in this repository contain the exercises I did while learning JavaScript. They include exercises on variables (1-2), math operations (3-4, 15, 18), string methods and properties (5-9), taking information from the user (10-12), parsing (12-15), math objects and conditions [if ... else and switch (15-18)] and loops [for and do ... while (19-21)].
